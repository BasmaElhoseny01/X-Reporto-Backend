                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chest tube to waterseal, patient with T3 transection.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  There is no evident large
 pneumothorax.  Right lower lobe opacities consistent with atelectasis are
 unchanged.  Left perihilar and left lower lobe opacities are stable consistent
 with infectious process.  The small left pleural effusion is minimally
 increased.  Bilateral rib fractures are again noted.  Tracheostomy tube is in
 standard position.
