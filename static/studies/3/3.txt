                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation at outside hospital for head bleed.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 9:25.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is in standard position, terminating approximately 4.6
 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm into
 the stomach and off the inferior borders of the film.  Heart size is mildly
 enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Bibasilar
 airspace opacities, more severe on the left, may reflect areas of atelectasis
 though aspiration or infection cannot be completely excluded.  Small left
 pleural effusion also may be present.  There is no pneumothorax.  No pulmonary
 vascular congestion is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Standard positioning of endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 
 2. Bibasilar opacities, more pronounced on the left, which could reflect areas
 of atelectasis though infection or aspiration are additional possibilities.  A
 small left pleural effusion may be present.
